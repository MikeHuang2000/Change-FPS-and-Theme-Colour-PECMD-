# PECMD Scripts for Toggling Screen Refresh Rate and Theme Dark/Light Modes

## SwitchRefreshRate.EXE

Currently, this script is configured to switch between 240Hz and 60Hz, optimized for my personal computer setup. Should you require adjustments, please use `ResourceHacker` to modify `SCRIPT\101:2052`.

This utility is designed to conserve laptop battery life during university lectures. Simply double-click to activate, offering a quicker solution than navigating through Windows settings to change configurations.

## SwitchThemeColor.EXE

This executable toggles the system theme between dark and light modes, specifically for the purpose of saving power during class sessions at university. A double-click is all it takes to enable the feature, which is faster than modifying settings via the Windows interface.

The functionality is implemented through registry modifications.
